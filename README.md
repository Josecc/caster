# caster
A URL casting chrome extension for the Roku player. 

I really just need a way to cast Pluralsight videos. I could not find one that worked well, then I came across "Roku URL Player and Remote", and its great but it needs the exact link for the video. 

I want to use the roku app to play videos (endpoint `/launch/63126?myurl=[encoded url]`) with this google extension and implement the following extra features:
 
 * Don't type the url, but have the extension figure it out automatically
 * Have a control remote
 * Have a directions page
 * Input the IP for the ROKU
 * Document the steps taken to create this extension :)
